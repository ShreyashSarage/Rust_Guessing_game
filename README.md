# Guessing Game(Rust Tutorials)
### How it works
- Here’s how it works: the program will generate a random integer between 1 and 100. It will then prompt the player to enter a guess. After a guess is entered, the program will indicate whether the guess is too low or too high. If the guess is correct, the game will print a congratulatory message and exit. 


### How to Run:
- Clone the repo to the local system 
- Then in the terminal run the below commands
-          cargo build
-          cargo run
